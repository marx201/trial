# First Steps
1. Create a simple java project containing a main method.
2. Creating a class called Employee.java which has 3 attributes (id, name, jobTitle)
3. Create a constructor inside Employee.java containing all three attributes
4. Create the default toString() Method inside Employee.java 
5. Go inside your main method and create an instance of Employee
6. Add System.out.println(employee) to see generated employee in console

# More object orientated programming
7. Generate a class called Doubleslash.java which has an initialized List of Employee
8. Add a default constructor inside Doubleslash.java (empty constructor)
9. Add a method named: addEmployeeToDoubleslash: This method should add an Employee to the List.
10. Go inside your main method and create an instance of Doubleslash
11. Use addEmployeeToDoubleslash to add your already created employee from step #5 to the List of Employee
12. Add System.out.println(doubleslash) to see the list of employee
13. Add another Employee and check output of console from #12 again

# More tasks
14. Add a method:removeEmployeeFromDoubleslash which can remove an existing employee from doubleslash
15. Extend employee to have an entryDate
16. Check output on console to have entryDate
17. Commit your changes to a GIT-Repo
18. Push your changes to GIT-Repo
19. Check your git repo and see changes

# Congrats you have finished...
